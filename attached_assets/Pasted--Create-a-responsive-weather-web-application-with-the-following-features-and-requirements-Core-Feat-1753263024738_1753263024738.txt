Core Features:

    Current Weather Display:

        Location name (city, country)

        Current temperature (in Celsius/Fahrenheit, toggleable)

        Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy) with an icon

        Real-feel temperature

        Humidity, wind speed, pressure, and UV index

    Forecast Section:

        5-day weather forecast with:

            Day/date

            High/low temperatures

            Weather condition icons

        Hourly forecast (next 12-24 hours) with temperature & conditions

    Location Services:

        Auto-detect user location (via browser geolocation API)

        Manual city search with autocomplete

    Interactive UI Elements:

        Toggle between Celsius/Fahrenheit

        Dark/light mode switch

        Animated weather icons (e.g., moving clouds, rain effects)

    Additional Features:

        Severe weather alerts (if applicable)

        Air quality index (AQI)

        Sunrise/sunset times

        Radar/map overlay (optional, e.g., using OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI)

Technical Requirements:

    Responsive Design: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop (use CSS Flexbox/Grid).

    API Integration: Fetch data from a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or AccuWeather).

    Performance: Optimized loading (cache API responses, lazy-load images).

    Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and contrast-friendly colors.

    Tech Stack:

        Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (SASS optional), JavaScript (React/Vue.js optional).

        Backend (if needed): Node.js/Express for proxy API calls (to hide API keys).

Design Guidelines:

    Clean, minimalist UI with intuitive icons.

    Use a color scheme that reflects weather conditions (e.g., blue for cold, orange for warm).

    Smooth transitions/animations for a polished feel.

Stretch Goals (Optional):

    Save favorite locations.

    Weather data charts (temperature/humidity trends).

    PWA (Progressive Web App) support for offline use."*
